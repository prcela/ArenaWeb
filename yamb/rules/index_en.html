<p>The game is played with 5 or 6 dice. Each turn consists of maximum 3 rolls. On the first roll you use all dice, while on other 2 rolls you can choose any amount of dice to roll. After 3rd roll, or if you wish earlier, you should select a combination to write down the score you have. After that you make another turn and so on untill the result table is filled.</p>
<h3>Rows</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>First 6 rows</strong> are simple combinations of 5 dice - sum of one, sum of two, three, etc.</li>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<img src="img1.jpeg" style="width: 150px;">
	<p>Sum of 1 = 3</p>
	<p>Sum of 6 = 18</p>
	<li>Next two rows are <strong>Max and Min</strong>, where the goal is to score maximum or minimum points from 5 rolled dice.</li>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<img src="img2.jpeg" style="width: 150px;">
	<p>Max = 3+4+6+6+4 = 23</p>
	<p>Min = 3+4+6+4+3 = 20</p>
	<li><strong>Straight</strong> - combination of 1,2,3,4,5 or 2,3,4,5,6</li>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<img src="img3.jpeg" style="width: 150px;">
	<li><strong>Full</strong> - combination of 3 equal and other 2 equal dice</li>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<img src="img4.jpeg" style="width: 150px;">
	<li><strong>Poker</strong> - combination of 4 equal dice</li>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<img src="img5.jpg" style="width: 150px;">
	<li><strong>Yamb</strong> - combination of 5 equal dice</li>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<img src="img6.jpeg" style="width: 150px;">
</ul>
<h3>Columns</h3>
<p>The columns in the table are "Down", "Up", "Random" and "Announce".</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down</strong> - The cells must be filled in order from top to down.</li>
	<li><strong>Up</strong> - The cells must be filled in order from bottom towards top.</li>
	<li><strong>Random</strong> - The cells can be filled without any order.</li>
	<li><strong>Announce (N)</strong> - The column can be filled only after the first roll in turn. You bid some combination that you will play. You cant change this decision after the 2nd or 3rd roll.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Score</h3>
<p>For your convinience the table has 3 subtotal rows which are for the points for the combinations on top of them.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>First 6 rows</strong> - The sum of all One or Two etc. If the sum of all first 6 rows are more than 60 you will be awarded with 30 bonus points.</li>
	<li><strong>Max</strong> - the maximum sum of 5 desired dice</li>
	<li><strong>Min</strong> - the minimum sum of 5 desired dice</li>
	<p>The Max and Min are not counted directly in the total score. The points you get for max minus points you get for Min are multiplied by the number of "Ones" in the first row.</p>
	<li><strong>Straight</strong> - 35 points for 1 to 5, or 40 points for 2 to 6.</li>
	<li><strong>Full</strong> - The sum of full dice + 30 bonus points.</li>

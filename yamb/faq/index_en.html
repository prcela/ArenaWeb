	<h2>What does my ⭐️ mean?</h2>
	<p>Stars represent an <b>ELO</b> rating system. Every player starts with 1000⭐️. The crucial feature of Elo rating system is this: beating a higher-rated opponent gives you more points than beating one with a lower rating. Similarly, when you lose to a player with a lower Elo score, your rating will decrease more than if the opponent had a higher initial rating.</p>
	<p>To make progress you must be better than yourself, better then expected. Once you reach Your skill level, you probably will stay there.</p>
	<p>ELO rating calculation is described <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/sports/elo#what-is-the-elo-rating-system">here</a></p>

	<h2>I got kicked out of the game, but I have good internet</h2>
	<p>WiFi isn't always the best solution. It uses radio waves, so the speed of your connection depends on how far away you are from the router and how good the router is. The farther away you are from the router, the weaker the signal will be and the slower your connection will be.	<p>Routers that you get from internet service providers are sometimes not the best quality. Because of them, WiFi repeaters are often used, which are garbage. Avoid that. A quality router that is added to the standard router is a better option.</p>
	<p>Routers from internet service providers are sometimes not the best quality. Because of that, people often use WiFi repeaters, which are terrible. Avoid them. A better option is to get a quality router that you can add to your standard router.</p>
	<p>However, sometimes the speed of your WiFi can be affected by your neighbors. If your neighbor has a slower WiFi than you do, and if your routers happen to be using the same frequency channel, your WiFi speed will drop to the speed of your neighbor's router. There are 14 frequency channels, so this is rare, but it can happen.</p>
	<p>For these reasons, I often tell players that it might be better to play on a mobile network. Mobile networks, like 3G, 4G, 5G, and LTE, are more reliable than WiFi, especially if you live in a crowded area.</p>

		<h2>Why can't I buy 💎?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Open the Settings app</li>
			<li>First item in list, Your Apple ID</li>
			<li>iTunes and App Store</li>

		<h2>My purchases are in pending state. Why?</h2>
		<p>First, we'd like to say that you can double-check by adding up the pending transactions to verify there's enough money in your account to cover them. Also, remember that purchases can take 1-3 days, sometimes more, to clear with the bank. Pending means, it has not been charged to your bank account yet.</p>

	<h2>What does my ranking mean?</h2>
	<p>Ranking is your position on leaderboard with 💎.</p>

	<h2>What does my ⭐️ mean?</h2>
	<p>Stars represent an <b>ELO</b> rating system. The crucial feature of Elo rating system is this: beating a higher-rated opponent gives you more ⭐️ than beating one with a lower rating. Similarly, when you lose to a player with a lower Elo score, your rating will decrease more than if the opponent had a higher initial rating.</p>
	<p>To make progress you must be better than yourself, better then expected. Once you reach Your skill level, you probably will stay there.</p>
	<p>ELO rating calculation is described <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/sports/elo#what-is-the-elo-rating-system">here</a></p>
	<p>You can receive a more ⭐️ in big <b>L</b> table, while <b>XS</b> table gives you the lowest amount of ⭐️.</p>
	<p>In "One vs all" game the ELO ranking will be calculated as You play with each play separately but with lower factor to avoid big jumps with ⭐️.</p>

	<p>It is used as fair play measure. For example 5/7 🤝 means that player has played totally 7 games against other player and he interupt the game 2 times.</p>

	<h2>What does 🥨 mean?</h2>

	<h2>Why can't I create a donation game?</h2>
	<p>Only players with more than 1M💎 can create a donation game.</p>

	<h2>Why didn't I receive the daily reward?</h2>
	<p>Your streak must be longer than the number of 🥨. The daily reward is not intended for players who are not actively playing.</p>


	<h2>Where is my profile? 🤔</h2>
	<p>Guests who have not been active for a year, who have not yet collected 100🥨 and who have not registered with an email will be automatically archived. Contact us if you still need old profile.</p>
